# Retro Tilemap Manager

**Retro Tilemap Manager** is a lightweight, fast, and easy-to-use tilemap management tool designed with a retro aesthetic in mind built in SFML.
Whether you're building a pixel-art platformer, a top-down RPG, or just prototyping your own 2D engine — this tool helps you stay focused on what matters most: **creating fun**.

With minimal dependencies and a clean codebase, it's perfect for small indie projects, game jams, or as a base for more complex systems.  
No bloat, no nonsense — just a solid, efficient workflow for handling tile-based maps.
